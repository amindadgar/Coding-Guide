Many of you might have heard about the term Competitive Programming and would have wondered what it means. I am writing this blog to provide a roadmap as well as a brief introduction to it. Even if you are not a computer science student, I would suggest you read this blog. The reason being it helps one develop logical aptitude and break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems. It teaches you how to deal with a problem under particular constraints and still produce an optimal solution.
Let’s dive into the world of competitive programming; I promise you won’t be disappointed:)
